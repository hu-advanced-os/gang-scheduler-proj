BUILD AND RUN
=============

to execute use the following files.

$projectDir/bin/c to compile.

$projectDir/bin/r to run an example.

$projectDir/bin/h to see help page.

ISSUES
======

1. calculation of default bounded standard deviation for -num-tasks-std

2. large values can be returned by normal distributions. the maximum value used is Integer.MAX_INT. i.e. still very large.
